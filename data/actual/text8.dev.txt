november one seven one nine four two in queens new york usa is an american film director a highly acclaimed film director scorsese s body of work addresses such themes as italian american identity catholic concepts of guilt and redemption machismo and the violence endemic in american society although he has received much critical acclaim and is one of the most recognizable names in the film industry he has never won an academy award despite numerous nominations scorsese is widely considered one of the most significant and influential of post war american film makers martin scorsese came from a working class italian american family his father luciano charles scorsese one nine one two one nine nine three and mother catherine scorsese one nine one two one nine nine seven both worked in new york s garment district a sickly child he spent much of his time recovering from asthma at home it was at this stage in his life that he developed his passion for cinema his initial desire to become a catholic priest was forsaken for cinema the catholic seminary traded for new york university where he received his m a in film in one nine six six career one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s scorsese attended new york university s film school b a english one nine six four m a film one nine six six making short films his most famous short is the blackly comic the big shave which featured an unnamed man who shaves himself until he is profusely bleeding ultimately slitting his own throat with his razor many critics have claimed the film is an indictment of america s involvement in vietnam whatever its thematic concerns one can argue its visceral quality prefigured the director s entire oeuvre he made his first feature length film the black and white who s that knocking at my door with fellow student actor harvey keitel and editor thelma schoonmaker both of whom were to become long term collaborators this film was a clear precursor perhaps even a dry run for his later mean streets even in embryonic form the scorsese style was already evident a feel for new york italian american street life rapid editing and an eclectic rock soundtrack from there he became a friend and acquaintance of the so called movie brats of the one nine seven zero s francis ford coppola brian de palma george lucas and steven spielberg it was de palma who introduced actor robert de niro to scorsese and the two figures became close friends working together on many projects scorsese during this period also worked as one of the editors of the movie woodstock in one nine seven two scorsese made his directing debut with a depression set gangster film boxcar bertha for famed b movie producer roger corman who had also helped directors such as francis ford coppola james cameron and john sayles launch their careers widely considered a minor work boxcar bertha however taught scorsese how to make films cheaply and quickly preparing him for his first film with de niro mean streets championed by influential movie critic pauline kael mean streets was a breakthrough for scorsese de niro and keitel by now the signature scorsese style was present and correct macho posturing bloody violence catholic guilt and redemption gritty new york locale rapid fire editing and the obligatory rock soundtrack although extraordinarily fresh innovative and exciting it s wired atmosphere edgy documentary style and gritty street level direction perhaps owes a debt to directors john cassavetes and early jean luc godard indeed the film was completed with much encouragement from cassavetes who felt boxcar bertha was undeserving of the young director s prodigious talent actress ellen burstyn chose scorsese to direct her in the one nine seven four movie alice doesn t live here anymore for which she won an oscar for best actress although well regarded the film remains an anomaly in the director s early career focussing as it does on a central female character returning to little italy in new york city to explore his ethnic roots scorsese next came up with italianamerican a rich documentary featuring his parents charles and catherine scorsese both of whom went on to make cameo appearances in several of his movies for many years his mother worked as the official caterer for all of scorsese s films and his father helped in the wardrobe department black and white publicity still from taxi driver one nine seven six martin scorsese s cameo with robert de niro two years later in one nine seven six scorsese sent shockwaves through the cinema world when he directed the iconic taxi driver an unrelentingly grim and violent portrayal of one mans slow descent in to psychosis in a hellishly conceived manhattan scorsese s direction by now was highly accomplished using jump cuts expressionist lighting point of view shots and slow motion to reflect the protagonist s heightened psychological awareness however taxi driver s immense power was no doubt in part down to robert de niro s intense lead performance notable support was also given by jodie foster and harvey keitel taxi driver also marked the start of a series of collaborations with writer paul schrader the film bares strong thematic links to and makes several allusions to the work of french director robert bresson most explicitly pickpocket in essence the diary of a loner obsessive who finds redemption writer director schrader often returns to bresson s work in films such as american gigolo light sleeper and scorsese s later bringing out the dead five years after taxi driver was released in one nine eight one john hinckley jr made an assassination attempt on the american president ronald reagan he subsequently blamed his act on his obsession with jodie foster s character iris in scorsese s movie in taxi driver de niro s character travis bickle makes an assassination attempt on a senator taxi driver won the palme d or at the cannes film festival and also received four oscar nominations including best picture although all were unsuccessful in this cameo scorsese lounges in front of the building where cybill shepherd s character works according to shepherd scorsese requested a cybill shepherd type for the role she played in taxi driver the critical success of taxi driver encouraged scorsese to move ahead with his first big budget project the highly styilized musical new york new york this heart felt tribute to scorsese s home town and the classic hollywood musical was a box office and critical failure new york new york was the director s third collaboration with robert de niro co starring with liza minelli an obvious tribute and allusion to her father legendary musical director vincente minelli although possessing scorsese s usual visual panache and stylistic bravura many critics felt its enclosed studio bound atmosphere left it leaden in comparison to his earlier work often overlooked it remains one of the director s early key studies in to male paranoia and insecurity and hence is in direct thematic lineage with mean streets taxi driver and the later raging bull the disappointing reception new york new york received drove scorsese into depression by this stage the director had also developed a serious cocaine addiction however he did find the creative drive to make what is arguably the finest film about rock and roll the last waltz one nine seven eight a beautifully photographed documentary of the final concert by the band another scorsese directed documentary entitled american boy also appeared in one nine seven eight focussing on steve prince the cocky gun salesman in taxi driver a period of wild partying followed damaging the director s already fragile health one nine eight zero s by many accounts scorsese s included robert deniro practically saved his life when he persuaded him to kick his cocaine addiction to make what many consider his greatest film raging bull one nine eight zero convinced that he would never make another movie he poured his energies into making this violent biopic of middleweight boxing champion jake la motta nicknamed the bronx bull the film is widely viewed as a masterpiece and was voted the greatest film of the one nine eight zero s by britain s prestigious sight and sound magazine it received eight oscar nominations including best picture best actor for robert de niro and scorsese s first for best director de niro won as did thelma schoonmaker for the editing but scorsese lost to first time director robert redford raging bull filmed in high contrast black and white is perhaps where the director s style reached its zenith taxi driver and new york new york had used elements of expressionism to replicate psychological point of view but here the style was taken to new extremes extensive slow motion complex tracking shots extravagant distortion of perspective the size of boxing rings would change from fight to fight thematically too the concerns carried on from mean streets and taxi driver insecure males violence guilt redemption although the screenplay to raging bull was credited to paul schrader and mardik martin who earlier co wrote mean streets the finished script differed extensively from schrader s original draft it was re written several times by various writers including jay cocks who went on to co script the age of innocence and gangs of new york it is widely believed that the final draft was written by scorsese and robert de niro scorsese s next project was his fifth collaboration with robert de niro king of comedy one nine eight three an absurdist satire on the world of media and celebrity it was an obvious departure from the more emotionally committed films he had become associated with visually too it was far less kinetic then the style the director had developed up until this point often using a static camera the expressionism of his recent work gave way to moments of almost total surrealism however it was still an obvious scorsese work apart from the new york locale it bared many similarities to taxi driver not least its focus on an obsessed troubled loner who ironically achives iconic status through a criminal act murder and kidnapping respectively king of comedy bombed at the box office but has become increasingly well regarded by critics in the years since its release it is arguable that its themes of vacuous showbiz and celebrity obsession are more pertinent today then when the film was originally released in one nine eight three scorsese began work on a long cherished personal project the last temptation of christ based on the one nine five one book written by nikos kazantzakis which was introduced to the director by actress barbara hershey when they were both attending new york university in the late one nine six zero s the movie was slated to shoot under the paramount studios banner but shortly before principal photography was to commence paramount pulled the plug on the project citing pressure from religious groups in this aborted one nine eight three version aidan quinn was cast as jesus and sting was cast as pontius pilate in the one nine eight eight version these roles were played by willem dafoe and david bowie after the collapse of this project scorsese again saw his career at a critical point as he described in the recent documentary filming for your life making after hours two zero zero four he saw that in the increasingly commercial world of one nine eight zero s hollywood the highly stylized and personal one nine seven zero s films he and others had built their careers on would not continue to enjoy the same status and decided on an almost totally new approach to his work with after hours one nine eight five he made an aesthetic shift back to a pared down almost underground filmmaking style his way of staying viable filmed on an extremely low budget on location and at night in the soho neighborhood of manhattan the film is a black comedy about one increasingly misfortunate night for a mild new york word processor griffin dunne and featured cameos by such disparate actors as terri garr and cheech and chong a bit of a stylistic anomaly for scorsese after hours fits in well with popular low budget cult films of the one nine eight zero s by lesser known directors e g something wild or repo man along with the iconic one nine eight seven michael jackson music video bad in one nine eight six scorsese made the color of money a sequel to the much admired paul newman film the hustler one nine six zero the original was directed by robert rossen whose one nine four zero s boxing film body and soul was a major influence on raging bull although typically visually assured the colour of money was the directors first foray in to mainstream commercial film making it won actor paul newman a belated oscar and gave scorsese the clout to finally secure backing for a project that had been a long time goal for him the last temptation of christ scorsese filmed the last temptation of christ on a low budget in one nine eight seven knowing that the film would be controversial and would not take in record box office revenues however he did not anticipate the furore and controversy his movie would spark when it was released a year later nationwide protests against the film made it a textbook case for the modern method of religious outrage and influence the movie did have a number of staunch supporters particularly among film critics including scorsese s friend roger ebert scorsese also received his second nomination for best director although the award would go to barry levinson the backing of the movie by important political figures kept scorsese from becoming an outcast in hollywood and it gave him the impetus to film goodfellas one nine nine zero to present with goodfellas scorsese returned to his native new york and reunited with robert de niro and joe pesci whom he had previously directed in raging bull this motion picture of life as a gangster has been called the greatest mob movie since the godfather and it secured scorsese a place among the greatest motion picture directors of all time he earned his third and some would argue most deserving best director nomination but again lost to a first time director kevin costner scorsese gives part of the credit for his inspiration for his two well known gangster films to musketeers of pig alley one of the first ever gangster films made by the biograph company in one nine one two scorsese went on to direct a remake of the one nine six two thriller cape fear which proved to hollywood that he could make a box office hit however scorsese s projects have continued to cast him as a figure who can make critically acclaimed pictures the age of innocence kundun that only turn in modest box office revenues he continued to be intimately involved in filmmaking through the one nine nine zero s making cameo appearances in movies like quiz show as an unscrupulous television sponsor and search and destroy and working to help up and coming filmmakers mad dog and glory clockers he re visited the world of taxi driver in one nine nine nine with bringing out the dead while critics said that his one nine nine five movie casino looked and felt like a re hash of goodfellas scorsese also voiced one of the characters in shark tale as will smith s visibly annoyed boss a blowfish in one nine nine zero martin scorsese acted in a cameo role as vincent van gogh in the film dreams by legendary japanese director akira kurosawa in one nine nine nine he produced a

cinecitta studios rome color timer was paolo verrucci scorsese s two zero zero two production of gangs of new york was seen as his biggest and most risk taking venture to date originally filmed for a

consequently delayed the film for nearly a year until its release in the oscar season of late two zero zero two with a production budget said to be in excess of one zero zero million this was scorsese s most expensive work critical reaction to the film was moderately positive movie critics familiar with scorsese s work felt it was flawed and while the movie wasn t a smashing box office blockbuster it wasn t a dismal failure in theatrical revenue in february of two zero zero three gangs of new york received ten academy award nominations including best picture best director and best actor for daniel day lewis this being his fourth best director nomination many thought it was finally his year to win but the award went instead to roman polanski scorsese s film the aviator is a biopic of

angelic often uses long tracking shots use of montage sequences involving aggressive camera movement and rapid editing set to popular music note his name is pronounced scor seh see themes the main themes of scorsese s work are intimately wrapped up in his roman catholic upbringing and his early attraction to the priesthood scorsese has once remarked that when he was growing up the most powerful people in his neighborhood were the gangsters and the priests he claims that as a filmmaker he is in some ways a combination of the two redemption and sin are the primary themes of scorsese s films his heroes tend to be fallen souls seeking redemption in a world of corruption they often achieve this redemption only through a passion a crucifixion of sorts in which a blood penance is extracted for their former sins charlie s final scene in mean streets travis bickle s psychotic rampage in taxi driver and jake lamotta s pounding his fists into the walls of his prison cell in raging bull would all seem to be expressions of this obsession with sin and redemption scorsese s films have oddly enough become more bleak in this regard as his career goes on goodfellas casino and the aviator all end with their protagonists trapped in a metaphorical purgatory from which it is uncertain they will be redeemed solitude and obsession also permeate scorsese s films his characters tend to be loners or misunderstood outcasts who are driven by emotional forces they cannot fully control over the course of his films these forces tend to gather strength until they erupt into a frenzy of emotional or physical violence it has been said that this is one of the factors which attracts actors to his films because it gives them the opportunity to play extremely emotionally dynamic characters the corruption of the material world and the fall from paradise are also persistent themes in scorsese s films particularly in his gangster films his characters are often torn between the temptations of the material world and the self betrayal of their own spirits that the material world demands of them this conflict often erupts into a cataclysmic fall from grace that sometimes leads to a quiet redemption this theme is most explicit in raging bull which ends with a new testament verse spoken by a blind man who has been given sight by jesus however this quote can be read as part of the film s dedication to haig p manoogian his nyu film school mentor oscar less director scorsese has been nominated five times for an oscar for best director but has never won this places him in the

scorsese felt that using a separate voice to make the distinction between keitel s thoughts and actions was necessary and it has never been done in a movie before or since when raising money for the film martin scorsese was offered a healthy sum by his mentor roger corman on the condition that he shoot the movie with an all black cast scorsese had to turn corman down based on a script which martin scorsese co wrote with mardik martin in the one nine six zero s entitled season of the witch the innovative use of the hand held camera was largely down to the fact that the film s meager

known autoimmune disorders and the antigens and disease mechanisms have been well identified weakness is caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors or the musk protein at the post synaptic neuromuscular junction inhibiting the stimulative effect of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine myasthenia is treated with immunosuppression and cholinesterase inhibitors signs and symptoms the hallmark of myasthenia gravis is muscle weakness that increases during periods of activity and improves after periods of rest certain muscles such as those that control eye and eyelid movement facial expression chewing talking and swallowing are often but not always involved in the disorder the muscles that control breathing and neck and limb movements can also be affected although myasthenia gravis may affect any voluntary muscle muscles that control eye and eyelid movement facial expression and swallowing are most frequently affected the onset of the disorder may be sudden or rapid symptoms often are not immediately recognized as myasthenia gravis a proportion only receives a diagnosis after more than a year in most cases the first noticeable symptom is weakness of the eye muscles in others difficulty in swallowing and slurred speech may be the first signs the degree of muscle weakness involved in myasthenia gravis varies greatly among patients ranging from a localized form limited to eye muscles ocular myasthenia to a severe or generalized form in which many muscles sometimes including those that control breathing are affected symptoms which vary in type and severity may include asymmetrical ptosis a drooping of one or both eyelids diplopia blurred or double vision due to weakness of the muscles that control eye movements unstable or waddling gait weakness in arms hands fingers legs and neck a change in facial expression dysphagia difficulty in swallowing and shortness of breath and dysarthria impaired speech often nasal due to weakness of the pharyngeal muscles a myasthenic crisis may give rise to a generalized paralysis including those of the respiratory muscles and assisted ventilation may be required to sustain life in patients whose respiratory muscles are already weak crises may be triggered by infection fever an adverse reaction to medication or emotional stress bedlack edrophonium test is infrequently performed to identify mg its application is limited to the situation when other investigations do not yield a conclusive diagnosis this test requires the intravenous administration of edrophonium chloride tensilon a drug that blocks the breakdown of acetylcholine by cholinesterase and temporarily increases the levels of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction in people with myasthenia gravis involving the eye muscles edrophonium chloride will briefly relieve weakness other methods to confirm the diagnosis include a version of nerve conduction study which tests for specific muscle fatigue by repetitive nerve stimulation this test records weakening muscle responses when the nerves are repetitively stimulated and helps to differentiate nerve disorders from muscle disorders repetitive stimulation of a nerve during a nerve conduction study may demonstrate decrements of the muscle action potential due to impaired nerve to muscle transmission imaging a chest x ray is frequently performed it may point towards alternative diagnoses e g lambert eaton due to a lung tumor and comborbidity it may also identify widening of the mediastinum suggestive of thymoma but computed tomography ct or magnetic resonance imaging mri are more senstive ways to identify thymomas and these are generally done for this reason pulmonary function test spirometry lung function testing may be performed to assess respiratory function if there are concerns about a patient s ability to breathe adequately severe myasthenia myasthenic crisis may cause respiratory failure due to exhaustion of the respiratory muscles pathophysiology myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease it features antibodies directed against the body s own proteins while in various similar diseases the disease has been linked to a cross reaction with an infective agent there is no known causative pathogen that could account for myasthenia there is a slight genetic predisposition particular hla types seem to predispose for mg b eight and dr three with dr one more specific for ocular myasthenia up to two five have a concurrent thymoma a tumor either benign or malignant of the thymus and other abnormalities are frequently found there are various theories that explain why thymoma may predispose to mg the disease process generally remains stationary after thymectomy removal of the thymus for tumor in mg the autoantibodies are directed against the acetylcholine receptor nicotinic type the receptor in the motor end plate for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine that stimulates muscular contraction some forms of the antibody impair the ability of acetylcholine to bind to receptors others lead to the destruction of receptors either by complement fixation or by inducing the muscle cell to eliminate the receptors through endocytosis in normal muscle contraction cumulative activation of the ach receptor leads to influx of sodium and calcium only when the levels of these electrolytes inside the muscle cell is high enough will it contract decreased numbers of functioning receptors therefore impairs muscular contraction epidemiology myasthenia gravis occurs in all ethnic groups and both genders it most commonly affects young adult women under four zero and older people of both sexes over six zero but it can occur at any age the prevalence in the united states is estimated at one four cases per one zero zero zero zero zero or roughly three six zero zero zero cases in the usa in neonatal myasthenia the fetus may acquire immune proteins antibodies from a mother affected with myasthenia gravis generally cases of neonatal myasthenia gravis are transient temporary and the child s symptoms usually disappear within few weeks after birth other children develop myasthenia gravis indistinguishable from adults myasthenia gravis is not directly inherited nor is it contagious occasionally the disease may occur in more than one member of the same family rarely children may show signs of congenital myasthenia or congenital myasthenic syndrome these are not autoimmune disorders but are caused by defective genes that control proteins in the acetylcholine receptor or in acetylcholinesterase treatment myasthenia gravis can usually be controlled with medication medication is used for two different endpoints direct improvement of the weakness reduction of the autoimmune process muscle function is improved by cholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine and pyridostigmine these slow the natural enzyme cholinesterase that degrades acetylcholine in the motor end plate the neurotransmitter is therefore around longer to stimulate its receptor immunosuppressive drugs such as prednisone cyclosporin and azathioprine may be used if the myasthenia is serious myasthenic crisis plasmapheresis is used to remove the putative antibody from the circulation similarly intravenous immunoglobulins ivig is used to bind the circulating antibodies thymectomy the surgical removal of the thymus gland which is abnormal in myasthenia gravis patients improves symptoms in more than five zero percent of patients even in those without thymoma some patients are cured by thymectomy suggesting that the thymus plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of myasthenia prognosis with treatment most patients have a near normal quality of life and no significant problems some cases of myasthenia gravis may go into remission temporarily and muscle weakness may disappear completely so that medication can be discontinued stable long lasting complete remissions are the goal of
