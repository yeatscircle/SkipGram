his most uncomplimentary reviews of his career despite announcing plans to retire which he made good on for most of the one nine eight zero s he subsequently gave interesting supporting performances in movies such as a dry white season for which he was again nominated for an oscar in one nine eight nine the freshman in one nine nine zero and don juan demarco in one nine nine five off screen along with his romances and marriages brando s crusades for civil rights the native american rights and other political causes kept him in the public eye throughout his career he married actress anna kashfi in one nine five seven mistakenly believing her to be of asian indian descent when she was in fact from wales and of irish catholic extraction her real name was joan o callaghan o callaghan didn t discourage brando s mistake in fact she dressed and made herself up as an indian beauty after learning that brando gravitated toward exotic women they divorced in one nine five nine after having one son christian brando together in one nine six zero brando married maria movita castaneda a mexican actress seven years his senior who had appeared in the first mutiny on the bounty film in one nine three five some two seven years before brando s own version was released a remake of mutiny on the bounty in one nine six two with brando as fletcher christian seemed to bolster his reputation as a difficult star he was blamed for a change in directors and a runaway budget though he disclaimed responsibility for either the bounty experience affected brando s life in a profound way he fell in love with tahiti and its people he took a nine nine year lease on part of an atoll island tetiaroa which he intended to make part environmental laboratory and part resort tahitian beauty tarita teriipia who had appeared in the film as fletcher christian s love interest became his third wife after he and castaneda were divorced teriipia became the mother of three of his children one of whom died see below the hotel on tetiaroa was eventually built it went through many redesigns due to changes demanded by brando over the years but is now closed a new hotel consisting of three zero deluxe villas is due to open in two zero zero eight in june one nine seven three brando broke paparazzo ron galella s jaw brando s hand became infected as a result in the following year galella wore a football helmet when snapping photos of brando in his one nine seven six biography the only contender by gary carey brando was quoted as saying like a large number of men i too have had homosexual experiences and i am not ashamed photographs circulate on the internet that appear to confirm this a two zero zero six book alleges affairs with rock hudson and cary grant an alleged long time lover of brando s was the actor wally cox brando is quoted as saying if wally had been a woman i would have married him and we would have lived happily ever after after cox died in one nine seven three brando kept his ashes for three zero years and they were eventually scattered with his own cox s third wife only discovered he possessed them after reading an interview in time magazine where brando is quoted as saying i have wally s ashes in my house i talk to him all the time she wanted to sue but her lawyers would not accept the case all three of brando s wives were pregnant when he married them the number of children he had is still in dispute although he recognized eleven children in his will they were ages as given in two zero zero five by his marriage to actress anna kashfi christian

tahitian lover of christian s half sister cheyenne at the family s hilltop home above beverly hills christian three one claimed the shooting was accidental after a heavily publicized trial christian was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter and use of a gun he was sentenced to one zero years before the sentencing marlon brando delivered an hour of rambling testimony in which he said he and his ex wife had failed christian he commented softly to members of the drollet family i m sorry if i could trade places with dag i would i m prepared for the consequences afterward drollet s father said he thought marlon brando was acting and his son was getting away with murder the tragedy was compounded in one nine nine five when cheyenne said to still be depressed over drollet s death committed suicide by hanging herself in tahiti she was only two five years old brando s notoriety his family s troubled lives his self exile from hollywood and his obesity unfortunately attracted more attention than his late acting career he also earned a reputation for being difficult on the set often unwilling or unable to memorize his lines and less interested in taking direction than in confronting the film director with odd and childish demands on the other hand most other actors found him generous funny and supportive although more and more reclusive in his declining years brando was by nature a casual and friendly man occasionally the public would observe the gargantuan brando stop by will wright s ice cream parlor enjoying his treat seated on two chairs he had pushed together the actor was a long time close friend of the entertainer michael jackson and paid regular visits to his neverland ranch resting there for weeks brando also participated in the singer s solo career three zero th anniversary celebration concerts in two zero zero one as well as starring in his one five minutes long music video you rock my world the same year the actor s son miko was jackson s bodyguard for several years and is also a friend of the singer on july one two zero zero four at six three zero p m local time brando died at the age of eight zero the cause of his death was intentionally withheld with his lawyer citing privacy concerns it was later revealed that he died at ucla medical center of lung failure brought on by pulmonary fibrosis he had also been suffering from congestive heart failure and diabetes which was causing his eyesight to fail and had also recently been diagnosed with liver cancer controversy the infamous playboy magazine interview of january one nine seven nine brando was charged with anti semitism in regard to his unfavorable opinion on jewish influence in hollywood you ve seen every single race besmirched but you never saw an unfavorable image of the kike because the jews were ever so watchful for that they never allowed it to be shown on screen brando generally kept his views to himself and withdrew from the public eye in later life brando portrayed george lincoln rockwell the american nazi party leader in the roots the next generation episode in which rockwell gave an interview to alex haley ironically also for playboy trivia brando in one nine four eight despite his later obesity brando would diet run and lift weights to keep in shape in his early to mid career he started to lift weights while in high school turned down the title role in lawrence of arabia turned down butch cassidy and the sundance kid in order to make burn he had eleven straight commercial disappointments between one nine five nine s the fugitive kind till one nine

forecasting meteorological phenomena are observable weather events which illuminate and are explained by the science of meteorology those events are bound by the variables that exist in earth s atmosphere they are temperature pressure water vapor and the gradients and interactions of each variable and how they change in time the majority of earth s observed weather is located in the troposphere meteorology climatology atmospheric physics and atmospheric chemistry are sub disciplines of the atmospheric sciences meteorology and hydrology comprise the interdiscplinary field of hydrometeorology history of meteorology early achievements in meteorology aristotle three five zero bc the term meteorology comes from aristotle s meteorology although the term meteorology is used today to describe a subdiscipline of the atmospheric sciences aristotle s work is more general the work touches upon much of what is known as the earth sciences in his own words all the affections we may call common to air and water and the kinds and parts of the earth and the affections of its parts one of the most impressive achievements in meteorology is his description of what is now known as the hydrologic cycle now the sun moving as it does sets up processes of change and becoming and decay and by its agency the finest and sweetest water is every day carried up and is dissolved into vapour and rises to the upper region where it is condensed again by the cold and so returns to the earth one six zero seven galileo galilei constructs a thermoscope not only did this device measure temperature but it represented a paradigm shift up to this point heat and cold were believed to be qualities of aristotle s elements fire water air and earth note there is some controversy about who actually built this first thermoscope there is some evidence for this device being independently built at several different times this is the era of the first recorded meteorological observations as there was no standard measurement they were of little use until the work of daniel gabriel fahrenheit and anders celsius in the one eight th century one six four three evangelista torricelli a contemporary and one time assistant of galileo creates the first man made sustained vacuum in one six four three and in the process creates the first barometer changes in height of mercury in this toricelli tube lead to his discovery that atmospheric pressure changes over time one six four eight blaise pascal discovers that atmospheric pressure decreases with height and deduces that there is a vacuum above the atmosphere one six six seven robert hooke builds an anemometer to measure windspeed one six eight six edmund halley maps the trade winds deduces that atmospheric changes are driven by solar heat and confirms the discoveries of pascal about atmospheric pressure one seven three five george hadley is the first to take the rotation of the earth into account to explain the behavior of the trade winds although the mechanism hadley described was incorrect predicting trade winds half as strong as the actual winds the circulating cells that hadley described later become known as hadley cells benjamin franklin one seven four three one seven eight four benjamin franklin observes that weather systems in north america move from west to east demonstrates that lightning is electricity

constructs a hair hygrometer to measure humidity one eight zero two one eight zero three luke howard writes on the modification of clouds in which he assigns cloud types latin names one eight zero six francis beaufort introduces his system for classifying wind speeds one eight three seven samuel morse invents the telegraph one eight six zero robert fitzroy uses the new telegraph system to gather daily observations from across england and develops synoptic charts allowing predictions to be made at the same time coining the term weather forecast the first ever daily weather forecasts were published by him in the times in one eight six zero and in the following year a system was introduced of hoisting storm warning cones at principal ports when a gale was expected the coriolis effect understanding the kinematics of how exactly the rotation of the earth affects airflow was partial at first late in the one nine th century the full extent of the large scale interaction of pressure gradient force and deflecting force that in the end causes air masses to move along isobars was understood early in the two zero th century this deflecting force was named the coriolis effect after gaspard gustave coriolis who had published in one eight three five on the energy yield of machines with rotating parts such as waterwheels in one eight five six william ferrel proposed the existence of a circulation cell in the mid latitudes with air being deflected by the coriolis force to create the prevailing westerly winds numerical weather prediction a meteorologist at the console of the ibm seven zero nine zero in the joint numerical weather prediction unit c one nine six five early in the two zero th century advances in the understanding of atmospheric physics led to the foundation of modern numerical weather prediction in one nine two two lewis fry richardson published weather prediction by numerical process which described how small terms in the fluid dynamics equations governing atmospheric flow could be neglected to allow numerical solutions to be found however the sheer number of calculations required was too large to be completed before the advent of computers at this time in norway a group of meteorologists led by vilhelm bjerknes developed the model that explains the generation intensification and ultimate decay the life cycle of midlatitude cyclones introducing the idea of fronts that is sharply defined boundaries between air masses the group included carl gustaf rossby who was the first to explain the large scale atmospheric flow in terms of fluid dynamics tor bergeron who first determined the mechanism by which rain forms and jacob bjerknes starting in the one nine five zero s numerical experiments with computers became feasible the first weather forecasts derived this way used barotropic that means single vertical level models and could successfully predict the large scale movement of midlatitude rossby waves that is the pattern of atmospheric lows and highs in the one nine six zero s the chaotic nature of the atmosphere was first understood by edward lorenz founding the field of chaos theory these advances have led to the current use of ensemble forecasting in most major forecasting centers to take into account uncertainty arising due to the chaotic nature of the atmosphere satellite observation in one nine six zero the launch of tiros one the first successful weather satellite marked the beginning of the age where weather information is available globally weather satellites along with more general purpose earth observing satellites circling the earth at various altitudes have become an indispensable tool for studying a wide range of phenomena from forest fires to el ni o in recent years climate models have been developed that feature a resolution comparable to older weather prediction models these climate models are used to investigate long term climate shifts such as what effects might be caused by human emission of greenhouse gases weather forecasting a meteorogist at work at the spc in norman ok meteorologists and weather presenters use several methods to predict what the weather will be like in the future most of these methods were used several decades ago before the seven zero s when computers simply did not exist or were unable to perform fast enough for numerical weather prediction they are used today to estimate the effectiveness of weather forecasting compared to persistence or to climatology analogs were a nightmare one could not find a reasonable match among the infinity of possibilities offered by the atmosphere frontology is used now as a means to describe objects resulting from nwp cold fronts exist but warm fronts are not fronts as such the symbol of warm air struggling against cold air does not represent the reality persistence method the persistence method assumes that conditions will not change often summarised as tomorrow equals today this method works best over short periods of time trends method the trends method involves determining the speed and direction of fronts high and low pressure centers and areas of clouds and precipitation climatology method the climatology method involves using historical weather data collected over long periods of time years to predict conditions on a given date analog method a complex method that involves finding an analog or very similar weather conditions from historical data numerical forecasting method the numerical weather prediction or nwp method uses computers to take into account a large number of variables and creates of computer model of the atmosphere this is the most successful and widely used method meteorology and climatology with the development of powerful new supercomputers like the earth simulator in japan mathematical modeling of the atmosphere can reach unprecedented accuracy this is not only due to the enhanced spatial and temporal resolution of the grids employed but also because these more powerful machines can model the earth as an integrated climate system where atmosphere ocean vegetation and man made influences depend on each other realistically the goal in global meteorological modeling can be termed earth system modeling with a growing number of models of various processes coupled to each other predictions for global effects like global warming and el ni o are expected to benefit substantially from these advancements regional models are attracting more interest as the resolution of global models increases with regional weather disasters such as the elbe flooding in two zero zero two and the european heat wave in two zero zero three decision makers expect from these models accurate assessments about the possible increase of these natural hazards in a specific region countermeasures such as dikes or intentional flooding might be effective in preventing or at least attenuating natural hazards for models at all scales increased model resolution means less reliance on parameterizations which are empirically derived expressions for processes that cannot be resolved on the model grid for example in mesoscale models individual clouds can now be resolved removing the need for formulations that average over a grid box in global modeling atmospheric waves such as gravity waves with short temporal and spatial scales can be represented without resorting to often overly simplified parameterizations meteorological topics and phenomena institutions of meteorology atmospheric science uiuc department of atmospheric sciences penn state university department of
